# Bandit Level 0

**Goal:** Log into the Bandit Server using ssh


**How:** using ssh

1. Open a terminal
2. Type this into the terminal

		ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
	
	**ssh:** this is the command
	
	**-p 2220:** this specifies the port to connect to
	
	**bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:** *bandit0* is the username and *@bandit.labs.overthewire.org* is the name of the server
3. When prompted for a password type ```bandit0```.  Do not be alarmed when the password does not appear while typing.
